# Regular Languages
This is a project to demonstrate operations over regular languages and its properties which include:
- Building a new language given an alphabet of symbols (e.g. a1, a2, a3, ...) or a range of characters (e.g. a-z).
- Alphabet to some exponent.
- String subsequence, substring, prefixes and suffixes.
- Language concatenation, substraction and validation.
- Regular Expressions.

Built with Rust to learn it from scratch.
